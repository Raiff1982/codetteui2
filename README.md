## 🚀 Modern Development Environment with AI Capabilities
### ✨ Current Status - September 2025 ✨

Codette is an experimental development environment that combines traditional IDE features with AI-enhanced capabilities. We believe in transparency about our capabilities, so here's an honest overview of what Codette currently can and cannot do:

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Backend Setup

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Unix/macOS
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Backend dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Frontend dependencies (if working on UI)
npm i
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
# Copy example env file
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

# Required environment variables (with defaults):
# - DATABASE_URL: SQLite by default (sqlite:///backend/data/codette.db)
# - ENVIRONMENT: development
# - API_HOST: 0.0.0.0 (listen all interfaces)
# - API_PORT: 8000
# - CORS_ORIGINS: http://localhost:5173 (Vite dev server)
# - RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE: 60
# - RATE_LIMIT_BURST: 10
```

Note: When running locally, ensure CORS_ORIGINS includes 'http://localhost:5173' for the Vite dev server.

4. Start the backend server:
```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload
python backend/start.py

# Or directly with uvicorn
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The backend will be available at http://localhost:8000 with API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs

### Frontend Environment Variables

Required environment variables for the frontend (create `.env` in project root):

```bash
# API Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000  # Backend API URL
VITE_API_URL=${VITE_API_BASE_URL}        # Legacy support, same as API_BASE_URL
VITE_ENV=development                      # Environment: development/production
VITE_DEBUG=true                          # Enable debug logging
VITE_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=local             # Deployment target: local/staging/production

# Supabase Integration (required for collaboration features)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url       # Supabase project URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key     # Supabase anonymous key
```

All environment variables are required unless marked as optional. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values.

### Error Tracking

Codette supports error tracking via Sentry. To enable:

1. Create a Sentry project and get your DSN
2. Add to your `.env`:
```bash
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
```

Error tracking is optional and will only be enabled in production if DSN is provided.

### Supabase Integration

Codette uses Supabase for real-time collaboration features and user data storage. Features requiring Supabase:
- Real-time file synchronization
- User preferences storage
- Shared code snippets
- Collaboration history

To enable Supabase features:

1. Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com
2. Add to your `.env`:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

Codette will run in local mode with mock data if Supabase is not configured.

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Tests
The backend includes comprehensive pytest-based tests. Run them with:
```bash
# Run all backend tests
cd backend
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_ai_systems.py

# Run with verbosity
python -m pytest -v
```

### Frontend Tests
Frontend testing is currently planned but not yet implemented. We intend to add:
- Unit tests with Vitest (planned)
- Integration tests with Playwright (planned)
- Component tests with Testing Library (planned)

Note: The frontend currently lacks test configuration. If you'd like to contribute test infrastructure, please see CONTRIBUTING.md.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

Codette can be deployed using Docker:

```bash
# Build frontend image
docker build -f backend/deploy/Dockerfile.frontend -t codette-frontend .

# Run frontend container
docker run -p 80:80 codette-frontend
```

Default ports:
- Frontend: 80 (HTTP)
- Backend: 8000 (API)

For custom port mapping:
```bash
# Map to different host port
docker run -p 3000:80 codette-frontend  # Access frontend on port 3000
```

The frontend container uses Nginx to serve static files and handle client-side routing. See `backend/deploy/nginx-frontend.conf` for the complete configuration.
